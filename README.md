#**ABOUT THE PROGRAM:**

  The Banking System is a system developed using PYTHON platform. It is a system that will store all the informations, balance, loans, bank accounts and bank money. This system adopts the idea of the banking feature of BDO, BPI and other banking platform. The principles we employ for systems are classes, objects, modularity, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation and json. The Users should select whether they are an admin or a customer; if they select admin, the system will use the Admin Login module; if they select customer, the system will use the Customer Login module. The admin menu contains the items mint money, burn money, open account, loan assessment, close account, access customer database, and display bank monetary collection, whereas the customer menu contains ATM and the ATM module contains the items deposit, withdraw, check balance, and pay loan. This system will automatically set the Customer ID and Account number. The admin menu's purpose is to access the customer's information, mint and burn money, open account funtion allows the admin to input the informations, bank account and the balance of the customer while the close account function allows the admin to delete certain accounts from the created bank accounts, admins can display the bank's funds, and if the customer requests a bank loan. The purpose of the Customer Menu or ATM is to deposit, withdraw, check balance, and pay the customer's loan. This Banking System can also store all the data information and bank funds by transferring from python to JSON.
