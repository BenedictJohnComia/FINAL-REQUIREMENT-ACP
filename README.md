# *ABOUT THE PROGRAM*

  The Banking System is a system developed using PYTHON platform. It is a system that will store all the data informations, balance, loans, bank accounts and bank money. This system adopts the idea of the banking feature of BDO, BPI and other banking platform. This system was inspired by database management and object oriented programming. this banking system is console-based, it is much simpler to comprehend and utilize. Talking about the system, it includes all of the fundamental features required in a bank. Our main system is located in the  *Bank Sytem*  and *ATM systems.* 
  
# *STEP BY STEP
  The Users should select whether they are an admin or a customer; if they select admin, the system will use the Admin Login module; if they select customer, the system will use the Customer Login module. The admin menu contains the items mint money, burn money, open account, loan assessment, close account, access customer database, and display bank monetary collection, whereas the customer menu contains ATM and the ATM module contains the items deposit, withdraw, check balance, and pay loan. This system will automatically set the Customer ID and Account number. The admin menu's purpose is to access the customer's information, mint and burn money, open account funtion allows the admin to input the informations, bank account and the balance of the customer while the close account function allows the admin to delete certain accounts from the created bank accounts, admins can display the bank's funds, and if the customer requests a bank loan. The purpose of the Customer Menu or ATM is to deposit, withdraw, check balance, and pay the customer's loan. This Banking System can also store all the data information and bank funds by transferring from python to JSON.

# *FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM*
* This Banking System had features of Object- Oriented Language which have classes, object encapsulation,  inheritance, polymorphism and modularity. 
* Banking System had error handling feature that can test a block for errors or handle the error.
* This system also includes a JSON package, which can be used to work with JSON data.

# *CONCLUSION*
This course assisted us in learning more about the Python programming language. It teaches us about OOP concepts, data structures, and algorithms. We anticipate that it will be easy to create a system as a requirement in the first week, but it will be difficult to complete this system. This coursework is extremely beneficial to us as we learn more about the Python programming language. Furthermore, it aided us in developing distinct different abilities and educated us on a variety of topics that will aid us in our future professional lives.
